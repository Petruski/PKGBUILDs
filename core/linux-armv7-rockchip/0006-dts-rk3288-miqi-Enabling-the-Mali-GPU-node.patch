Subject: [PATCH 06/33] dts: rk3288: miqi: Enabling the Mali GPU node

Why is the MiQi the only one left without a working mali GPU node ?

Seriously, is there a rk3288 chipset WITHOUT a mali GPU ? Couldn't
they enable it once in the DTSI, instead of defining it as "disabled"
and enabling it in every DTS file ?
